# Puzzlepia Current Work State

WORK-ID: PUZZLEPIA-WORD-RESUME
Phase: production release verified; observation next.
ACTIVE_WRITER = NONE
LAST_WRITER = CODEX (PUZZLEPIA-WORD-RESUME; 2026-10-15)

## Current Approved Work

- Owner requested the next retention improvement, a simple home page, and
  deployment after validation on 2026-10-15.
- Starting HEAD `583a7c0`; clean main matched origin/main after fetch.
- Add opt-in, browser-only saving for the latest Word Search set. Preserve the
  UTC daily pick, manual selection, completion and reset. No accounts, tracking,
  backend, other game changes, or new homepage sections.
- Update storage disclosure and test corrupt/expired/blocked storage, day
  rollover, restoring completion, and turning saving off before deployment.
- Local QA: PASS. Four-width matrix restored all fourteen completed sets,
  including partial progress/reset/opt-out/UTC rollover and previous-set resume.
  Blocked/corrupt/expired storage, quota errors, deletion errors, missing optional
  script, and multi-tab opt-out passed. Existing games initialized and reset.
- Unit tests, Hugo build, whitespace, internal references, sitemap and ignored
  output checks: PASS. Production verification: PASS after the asset refresh.
- Initial deployment `75e9bd3` succeeded. Fresh production sessions passed
  resume flows, but the first validation browser cached an HTML fallback at the
  new progress script URL. The output name was changed to
  `word-search-progress-v1` to avoid that cached response without modifying
  Cloudflare settings. Repeated production verification passed, including the
  previously affected browser session.
- Local/live main CSS fingerprints differ only in minified whitespace before
  `!important`; validate the live HTML's asset references, not stale local URLs.

## Publishing Approval

- On 2026-10-14 the owner explicitly approved the GitHub deployment exception
  for this repository and requested pushing validated changes and checking the
  live site. This exception does not apply to other BornstarSoft repositories.
- Preserve the existing `https://github.com/bornstarsoft/puzzlepia-site.git`
  origin and Git-connected Cloudflare Pages deployment. No hosting/DNS changes.
- 2026-10-14 released application HEAD: `c095c97`, including `d71f224` and `ad47034`.
- Fetch succeeded; `main` was clean and three commits ahead of `origin/main`.

## Previous Implementation Evidence

- Owner approved proceeding with the retention plan on 2026-10-14.
- HEAD: `d71f224`; clean worktree, two local commits ahead of cached `origin/main`.
- No project AGENTS.md, CURRENT_STATE, or other ACTIVE_WRITER record was found.
- GitHub publishing was originally blocked by global Gitea-only policy. The
  repository-specific owner approval above resolves that blocker.

## Previous Word Search Scope

- Keep Hugo, vanilla JavaScript, existing routes, and other games intact.
- Add fourteen fixed Word Search boards, a date-based pick, manual practice
  selection, and a completion-only next-set action.
- Preserve drag, tap endpoints, word-list fallback, completion, and reset.
- No accounts, analytics, storage, new dependencies, or Phaser changes.
- Follow with local data/state tests, mobile/desktop browser QA, and Hugo checks.

## Production Verification: 2026-10-14

- GitHub push succeeded without manual credential entry or force push.
- Cloudflare Pages check for `c095c97` completed successfully at 10:13:09 UTC
  (19:13:09 KST). No Cloudflare/DNS configuration was changed.
- The live home page shows seven playable puzzles and the new previews.
  Word Search exposes fourteen sets; Memory Pairs and Make 10 are playable.
- Chromium on `https://puzzlepia.com/`: 390, 430, 768, and 1280px; 36 core,
  game-directory, and guide-page checks, correct canonicals, no horizontal
  overflow, no console/page errors, and no failed HTTP responses in the matrix.
- Live Word Search: 24 completions across starter, diagonal, and final sets;
  endpoint clicks, desktop drag, reset before/after completion, repeat completion,
  and next-set wrap passed. A separate emulated-touch completion/reset passed.
- Live pair games: 16 completions; Block Puzzle: four completions. Reset passed.
- Footer destinations, new challenge pages, sitemap, and robots returned 200.
  Sitemap includes the new games. All home images decoded after scrolling;
  eighteen current image/script assets matched local SHA-256 hashes.
- Direct Python HTTP access returned 403 once; real Chromium navigation and
  same-origin fetches passed. No access/security settings were altered.
- Local checks passed: `bash tools/check_site.sh`, both puzzle test scripts,
  `hugo --gc --minify`, and `git diff --check`. Generated `public/` and
  `resources/_gen/` remain ignored and untracked.

## Production Verification: 2026-10-15

- Application commits `75e9bd3` and `ca81986` were pushed; their Cloudflare Pages
  checks succeeded. No DNS, Cloudflare settings, accounts, or analytics changes.
- Fresh Chromium sessions at 390, 430, 768, and 1280px passed twelve set-resume
  scenarios on the real domain: partial progress, completed progress, reset and
  reload, and opt-out deletion. Mobile tests used touch taps.
- Twenty live core-page checks passed with no overflow. The final browser matrix
  reported no console/page errors. The homepage has no new sections or controls.
- All seven same-origin script/style references returned the appropriate MIME
  types; fingerprinted asset bytes matched their URLs. The original browser
  that cached the bad response also loaded the refreshed progress module.
- Footer destinations, sitemap, and robots returned 200. Storage disclosure is
  live on `/privacy/`. Local no-JavaScript fallback and desktop drag-save-reload
  checks also passed. Generated output remains ignored and untracked.

DONE: Optional latest-set Word Search resume implemented, validated and deployed.
HEAD/WIP: Application HEAD `ca81986`; documentation handoff commit is titled
`Record Puzzlepia word search resume deployment`. No uncommitted source work.
QA: PASS for local unit/browser/build checks and final production verification.
QA: NOT_RUN for native Safari devices, Search Console indexing, and retention
measurement. This release does not prove improved traffic or business outcomes.
NEXT_SINGLE_TASK: Review a comparable seven-day analytics window before choosing
another retention change; no automatic monitoring is scheduled.
BLOCKER: None. GitHub exception applies only to this repository; future pushes
still require task authorization, and credential prompts require manual entry.
